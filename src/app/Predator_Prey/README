This file give a simple description for the predator and prey project.
The project directory is at http://svn.bio-tracking.org/biosim/src/app/Predator_Prey/

=========================================================================
Files
=========================================================================
Hunt.java		the drive class for the hunt process
HuntConfig.java		the initial environment setup (like obstacles, number of agents, speed limitation and so on) for the hunt
PredatorController.java	in which the takeStep() function tell the body of predator what to do every cycle
PreyController.java	in which the takeStep() function tell the body of prey what to do every cycle
BatchRun.java		run the simulation without UI multiple times and save statistics data
Makefile		the make file

=========================================================================
compile
=========================================================================
In the root of biosim directory, 
source config-classpath.sh
make

Then the whole biosim is compiled. If you found it is time taking, compile only the Hunt simulation:
In the biosim/src/app/Predator_Prey:
source ./../../../config-classpath.sh
make

=========================================================================
run
=========================================================================
In the root of biosim directory:
source config-classpath.sh
java app.Predator_Prey.Hunt

=========================================================================
run in batch
=========================================================================
In the root of biosim directory:
source config-classpath.sh
java app.Predator_Prey.BatchRun $seconds_per_simulation $simulation_amount > $target_log
For example:
java app.Predator_Prey.BatchRun 100 10 > /log/PredatorPreyLog.txt
This command will run the simulation without UI for 10 times in which each simulaiton will stop at 100 seconds. And the statistics will be recorded at biosim/log/PredatorPreyLog.txt

=========================================================================
Frequent problems
=========================================================================
Meet compile or run errors: the console is not in the right directory or the "source" is not specified.
How the body is defined: the predator and prey body is located in biosim/src/core/basic_api/body/*.java
The log data of run in batch is missed or wrong: (1)Make sure it's the exact log file which is specified in the command: java app.Predator_Prey.BatchRun $seconds_per_simulation $simulation_amount > $target_log; (2)Tune the parameters because if the $seconds_per_simulaiton is too small, the predators may not hunt down all the preys which will not be logged.

=========================================================================
what to do
=========================================================================
Your work should limited in PredatorController.java and PreyController.java. Other files are defined and should not be modified.
For other objectives, Professor Balch will give more details in class or wiki.
